# Brain Tumor Classification using Kaggle's Brain MRI Dataset [Work-in-Progress]

This project's objective is to use brain MRI scans to build a deep learning model that would correctly classify if a scan image has a tumor or not. Also, using GRAD-CAM algorithm, we'll try to find the regions the model is looking at for making predictions.

The project has been partially completed using Google Colab. I would like to modularize the project using reusable functions so that this project can be used with other types of scans as well and finally deploying a web app using Streamlit.
